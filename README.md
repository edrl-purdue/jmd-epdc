By: Homero Valladares and Andres Tovar

This is a repository for the multi-objective Bayesian optimization method proposed in the 2023 journal paper: ["Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization Supported by an Expected Pareto Distance Change"](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/mechanicaldesign/article-abstract/145/10/101705/1164097/Multi-Objective-Bayesian-Optimization-Supported-by) published in the Journal of Mechanical Design (JMD). The results presented in the paper were generated using the attached files and the Python libraries listed in the requirements.txt file. This repository was implemented using Python 3.11.5.
